Benu
====

Operating System Increments for Education and Research
(_Built for _education, _not (normal) _usage)

Simple operating system for demonstration only (academic).
Build through several steps, each bringing something new.
System is "work in progress", improved/extended (almost) every year.
Benu goal is to teach you OS, and to inspire you to create your own OS!

Name "Benu", besides acronym, represents an Egyptian bird ...

Tools required for building:
* for i386 - GNU gcc, GNU ld (GNU Binutils)

* for ARM - package for Ubuntu: gcc-arm-none-eabi

Tested in QEMU ('qemu-system' package on ubuntu)

IMPORTANT!
==========
If running created system (built from Benu) in emulator other than QEMU, set
standard input and output to vga_text mode -- in i386/config.ini set:
K_INITIAL_STDOUT = vga_text_dev
K_STDOUT = VGA_TXT
U_STDIN = i8042
U_STDOUT = VGA_TXT
U_STDERR = VGA_TXT
(uncomment this lines, comment other with *=COM1)
(Buggy serial port implementation; works on QEMU but not with other emulators)


Please report any bugs (and other problems) via email.

DISCLAIMER
==========
Presented system has (probably) *many* bugs! (What is an OS without bugs? :) )
Many concepts might not be adequate or good as might be (as are in some
"real systems").
*Please* do not use it for any other purpose other than experimentation or
education. Itâ€™s not tested near enough to be used for anything more.
